# SYRAS - A Systematic Review Assistant

SYRAS is an online reference screening tool, aimed at assisting the process of reviewing thousands of articles during a systematic review. 

Where does SYRAS fit into the wider review process?

A typical workflow scenario might be summarised as follows:

1. Journal database article search (sourcing articles by keyword, reference/citations)
2. **Systematic Review Process (filtering thousands down to dozens)**
3. Data extraction (of experimental methods, results/statistics)
4. Meta-analysis and/or further research.

SYRAS will help you with Step 2. It allows you to import from journal database searches in common formats (RIS, PubMed) and merge and deduplicate the resulting reference sets into a unified library. You can then quickly screen the references by title and abstracts (alone or in a team of reviewers) flagging the articles which are relevent to your study. Once you have a settled on the subset of relevent references, you may export this list to another RIS or PubMed file, for import into Endnote or other document management system to purchase the articles. You can return to SYRAS later and add further references and repeat the process or modify your choices - supporting a wide variety of workflows.
